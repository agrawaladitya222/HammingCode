This program incorporates an encoder and a decoder that make use of Hamming(8,4) codes. The encoder will generate the Hamming codes given an input file and output them to the specified output file.
The decoder will decode the given file generated Hamming codes and output the decoded message to the specified output file. This is done by implementing bit vectors and bit matrices that utilize bitwise operations on bytes to get,set,clear, or xor bits. A byte is turned into a Hamming code by turning it into a vector and multiplying it by a generator matrix, then to decode that Hamming code the code is turned into a vector yet again and then multiplied by the transpose of the parity checker matrix and then turned back into a byte. To run the program and create all executable files entropy, error, encode, and decode run the command "make all" or "make". If you just want one of the singular executable files run the command "make" followed by either encode, decode, error, or entropy. The command make clean will remove all files that are generated by the compiler and the command make format will format all the source code and header files. Encode and Decode support the following command line options -i infile: specifies the input file, -o outfile: specifies the output file, -h prints a help message and decode also includes the option -v: which will specify if you want the stats of how many bytes were processed and corrected.
